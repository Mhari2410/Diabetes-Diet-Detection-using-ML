# 🩺 Diabetes Detection and Diet Plan Generation using Machine Learning

This mini project aims to support early detection of diabetes and recommend personalized diet plans based on prediction results. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze health data and promote preventive healthcare.

## 📌 Features

- Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user input
- Generates basic diet plans tailored to the prediction outcome
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction
- Trained using real-world health data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Streamlit or Tkinter (for GUI, if applicable)

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains diagnostic measurements for predicting diabetes.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com//Mhari2410//Diabetes-Diet-Detection-using-ML.git
   cd Diabetes-Diet-Plan-Generation
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   * For script:

     ```bash
     python diabetes_predictor.py
     ```
   * For Streamlit UI:

     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

## 📊 Output

* Diabetes prediction: **Positive / Negative**
* Diet recommendation: e.g., low-carb, diabetic-friendly, or balanced meals
* Performance metrics of the model: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.
